# TSC Docsy
TSC Docsy is a Jekyll theme that allows teams to quickly create documentation pages for their services and products.

Docsy's files are hosted centrally and managed by the Docsy team, meaning teams can focus on their creative journeys rather than continually updating assets hosted externally.
